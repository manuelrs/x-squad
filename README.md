# x-squad
Simple front-end application, created as part of the technical interview at X-Squad, according to following specification:

https://gist.github.com/GoMino/8639ddca10b966a8c6a20060160286e4

The main functionality is the sign-up function, where a user registration is simulated using the JSON placeholder API:

http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

The user log-in is implemented by saving the user's information in the localstorage. When the user logs out, the local storage is deleted.
